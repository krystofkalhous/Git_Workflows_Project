### Centralized Workflow

The Centralized Workflow uses a central repository to serve as the single point-of-entry for all changes to the project. The default development branch is called main, and all changes are committed into this branch. This workflow doesnâ€™t require any other branches besides main. 

The Centralized Workflow is like other workflows in its utilization of a remote server-side hosted repository that developers push and pull from. Compared to other workflows, the Centralized Workflow has no defined pull request or forking patterns. A Centralized Workflow is generally better suited for smaller size teams.
